Malware Family/Delivery Mechanism(s):
QakBot

Phenotype(s):
Banker

Malware Family Synopsis:
QakBot - QakBot is a banking trojan with worm like features for self propagation. It is a modular malware that is capable of information stealing, securing a backdoor, self propagation, and anti-research / anti-virus evasion. This malware also has a sophisticated persistence ability, including frequently changing the file and recompiling the entire binary to evade detection. The harvesting of banking information is carried out by a man-in-the-browser technique. This allows for QakBot to manipulate banking web-pages to direct users to input sensitive information that can be collected and ex-filtrated later.
